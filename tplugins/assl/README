aSSL 1.2 (beta3) for PHP
(c) 2006+ Francesco Sullo, http://assl.sullof.com

aSSL is a library distributed under MIT License (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) thats implements a technology similar to SSL without HTTPS.

aSSL enables the client to negotiate a secret random 128-bit key with the server using the RSA algorithm. Once the connection has been established, the data will be sent and received using AES algorithm.

aSSL is composed of some Javascript files and a server side component. Because I have recently changed the negotiation algoritm from RC4 to RSA, only a pure Javascript (ASP) server component is currently available. I will do a porting for the main web languages (PHP, Java, Perl, Python, TKL, etc.) as soon as possible once the library has passed the beta phase.
